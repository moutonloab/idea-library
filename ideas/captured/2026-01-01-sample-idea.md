# Description

Build a system to capture, organize, and distill ideas that emerge throughout daily life. The system should reduce friction in capturing ideas while providing structure for transforming them into actionable insights.

## Context

Ideas often emerge at inconvenient times or get lost in scattered notes across different platforms. There's a need for a unified, accessible system that respects the natural flow of creative thinking while providing enough structure to prevent ideas from being forgotten or remaining undeveloped.

## Initial Thoughts

- The system should work with existing workflows (GitHub, markdown)
- Accessibility is crucial - ideas should be captured from anywhere
- Plain text ensures longevity and portability
- Visual organization helps with pattern recognition
- The process should guide ideas from capture to action

## Insights

*To be developed as the idea matures*

## Action Items

*Add when idea reaches 'actionable' status*

## Notes

This is a sample idea demonstrating the structure. Real ideas will be more detailed and evolve over time as they move through different statuses.

# idea-library

A library to frictionlessly capture ideas that emerge from my inner world, organize them in a timeless and logical structure, intuitively distill their essence into insights, and express them to the outer world, ready to be turned into action.

## Vision

This project aims to bridge the gap between thought and action by providing:
- **Frictionless Capture**: Quick and easy idea recording
- **Logical Organization**: Timeless structure for managing ideas
- **Intuitive Distillation**: Tools to extract insights
- **Action-Ready Output**: Transform ideas into actionable items

## Documentation

- **[ARCHITECTURE.md](./ARCHITECTURE.md)**: Comprehensive architectural blueprint with design principles, technical stack, and implementation details
- **[ROADMAP.md](./ROADMAP.md)**: Phased implementation plan from MVP to advanced features
- **[DESIGN-PRINCIPLES-REVIEW.md](./DESIGN-PRINCIPLES-REVIEW.md)**: Analysis of design principles and best practices for knowledge management systems
- **[DESIGN-RATIONALE.md](./DESIGN-RATIONALE.md)**: Detailed rationale for architectural decisions

## Design Principles

1. **Simplicity First**: Minimal viable architecture, avoid over-engineering, proven technologies
2. **Accessibility by Design**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliant, keyboard navigable, screen reader optimized
3. **Easy to Maintain**: Low operational overhead, automated workflows, minimal manual intervention
4. **Privacy-First & Data Ownership**: You own your data, private by default, no vendor lock-in
5. **Future-Proof & Portable**: Standard formats, platform independence, 10+ year viability
6. **Content-First Design**: Content drives structure, minimal ceremony, fast and searchable

See [DESIGN-PRINCIPLES-REVIEW.md](./DESIGN-PRINCIPLES-REVIEW.md) for detailed rationale and best practices.

## Technology Stack

- **Content**: Markdown with YAML frontmatter
- **Build**: 11ty (Eleventy) static site generator
- **Hosting**: GitHub Pages
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions
- **Accessibility**: Semantic HTML5, ARIA, progressive enhancement

## Current Status

**Phase**: Foundation (Phase 0) → Moving to MVP (Phase 1)

See [ROADMAP.md](./ROADMAP.md) for detailed implementation phases.
